Hey! KVK here, live blogging* the MapBox hands-on tutorial for the <a href="http://cugos.org/2016-spring-fling/">CUGOS Spring Fling 2016</a>. CUGOS (Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source) is the Cascadia chapter OSGeo. The group is a curious case of professionals, academics, and students who are passionate about opensource anything and GIS. The Spring Fling is an annual event, held this year on the UW campus, consisting of talks, presentations, and workshops.

This years workshop is meant for beginners (read: have no prior experience with) and goes through creating maps with MapBox Studio. If you are interested in learning on your own, check out the tutorial made from the MapBox folks right <a href="http://cugos.org/studio-workshop/">here</a>.

Part 1. What is MapBox?
Straight from their "about" page, Mapbox is a mapping platform for developers. Mapbox is an opensource initiative, meaning it is built on open source parts, work in the open, and release their code for anyone to see.

You don't have to be a developer making some big product to use Mapbox. Anyone can!! Hence this workshop.

Underlying data that makes up MapBox is from OpenStreetMap, a citizen science, collaborative, data conglomerate. Satellite data from NASA; creates a cloudless, seamless, basemap.

You are not limited to the existing data in mapbox studio. Add your own data!

Part 2. The MapBox Studio Editor
Create new style, choose streets as basic, and play around. I earned a minor in GIS, and have played around a lot with open source GIS software, with and without GUI's.. This part is fun!

Publish your data! Three choices: Share the URL, develop it (javascript), use in another platform(ie:arcgis)

Here is mine!<a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kvonkrusenstiern/cin27l5u7009nabnqbeqvxzgy.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3ZvbmtydXNlbnN0aWVybiIsImEiOiJjaWg0MHo3d2QweTMxdnFtM3I3NHNqaHh6In0.oHCT_zMio7G2ft24bm9gmw#2/45.711230692599344/-110.65713129450569/0">Click here!</a> It's not fancy, I simply changed the color of the "country" label.

My first thoughts: easy to use tool to create basemap and showcase data.

Part 3. Adding custom data

Heyyo! You can add your own data with Studio!

Your new layer is added as tileset. Or is it tileset is added as a layer? Example with Seattle cameras.

Mine is <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kvonkrusenstiern/cin286spo001ea6melrc7ze2k.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3ZvbmtydXNlbnN0aWVybiIsImEiOiJjaWg0MHo3d2QweTMxdnFtM3I3NHNqaHh6In0.oHCT_zMio7G2ft24bm9gmw#10/47.60651183080344/-122.35480472330534/0">here!</a>

part 4. Getting fancier!!

More personalizing. Playing around with polygons, and working with styles. Check out <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kvonkrusenstiern/cin286spo001ea6melrc7ze2k.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3ZvbmtydXNlbnN0aWVybiIsImEiOiJjaWg0MHo3d2QweTMxdnFtM3I3NHNqaHh6In0.oHCT_zMio7G2ft24bm9gmw#16/47.65201907306417/-122.3076395573712/0">these</a> rad hatched buildings at UW campus in Seattle, WA!

Second thoughts: I'm excited to style my own basemaps to have ready at hand for personalized maps.

Wrap up: The workshop continued, and I continued playing around with the different features, admittedly not listening to the rest of the tutorial.

** disclaimer: I've never live blogged before. I went back and fixed spelling errors and added a few sentences.
