I recently read an essay titled, “On my way to being a scientist,” by Thomas M. Schofeld. The essay was published by Nature in 2013, posthumously. To me, the essay is huge. On my drive home from the lab, I could not get Schofeld’s simple and eloquent words out of my head. After my evening run and after dinner, I reread the piece a few more times. I thought about what they meant to me and where I am on my way to becoming a scientist. 

These are my thoughts:

After nearly five years away from academics, I just began a M.Sc. in the field of oceanography. I am in a new world, and am grateful for the opportunity to explore realm of information that doesn’t naturally align with my undergraduate studies. Navigating research is overwhelming, but Schofeld’s words have given me a firm anchor to fall back on when I think of myself, and my now path into the marine sciences(1). 

>In this piece, Schofeld elaborates on what he sees as the four stages to becoming a scientist. His thesis: that science is >not about the truth. The fourth phase especially resonated with me.

“This is when you realize that science is not about finding the truth at all, but about finding better ways of being wrong. The best scientific theory is not the one that reveals the truth — that is impossible. It is the one that explains what we already know about the world in the simplest way possible, and that makes useful predictions about the future.”

Science isn’t about answers, but rather questions. The only “truth” is that every result leads to more questions, and consequently more research. I love this idea because it shows that science will never die, and every experiment will carry a legacy.

When I read the above paragraph, I connect it to my current research. I interested in hydrodynamics and morphological evolution of coastal environments, specifically in a tidal-dominated estuary. There is one common theme in every journal article I read, and all the pieces of background information I engross myself: the coastal environment is governed by complicated, non-linear processes. Making sense of them is not easy.

With my research as an M.Sc student, I hope that I can resolve even just the smallest mystery of coastal dominated processes in a simple and useful way. Most importantly, I hope another individual, team, or whoever can learn and grow from my conclusions. In science, this is how you keep innovating.
