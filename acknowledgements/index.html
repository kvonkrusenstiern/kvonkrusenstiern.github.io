<p>Many acknowledgements are in order.</p>
<p>For the git and jekyll guide on which this website is built and designed around. Thank you to Jonathon Mcglone who wrote <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Creating Hosting a Personal Website on Github</a>, which I emulated and then personalized (and am still personalizing). </p>
