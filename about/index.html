	<h1></h1>
	<p>My name is Kate von Krusenstiern, and this is my personal website. Currently, I am a bartender/server/busser in the midst of applying to graduate programs. I want to study the ocean floor, specifically questions in seafloor morphology and sediment processes. I hope to study what is happening nearshore, shallow waters, and that my research can be used to improve coastal resilience. So add Soon-To-Be-Student to my occupation list. My education background is in Physical Geography, Environmental Geology, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As a M.Sc. student I hope to apply my undergraduate background in a new field: oceanography.</p>
	
	<p>I am interested in all things open source, particulary those in geospatial technologies. I like cartography, downshill skiing, and rock climbing. I am building this website to serve as a portfolio of my work, thoughts, and antics in academic. and anticipate updating it as I further my education and career.</p>
