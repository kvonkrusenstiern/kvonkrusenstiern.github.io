	<h1>Hi, and welcome to my website,</h1>
	<p>I am a Graduate Research Student at University of New Hampshire, on my way to earning a M.Sc. in Oceanography.</p>
	<p>My research uses observations and models to better understand how waves and currents move sediment in beaches, inlets, and estuaries. My interests are motivated by the increasing vulnerability of coastlines in the face of climate change, sea level rise, and increased frequency/intensity of storms. I believe that improving our ability to make quantitative predictions of morphologic change in coastal environments underpins efforts to build resilient coastal communities.</p>
