	<p>Hi, and welcome to my website. I am a Graduate Research Student at University of New Hampshire, where I am on my way to earning a M.Sc. in Oceanography.</p>
	<p>My research interests are in coastal geomorphology and nearshore processes -- I am interested in methodologies and measurement systems that advance understanding of how waves and currents move sediment in beaches, inlets, estuaries, and the continental shelf. </p>
